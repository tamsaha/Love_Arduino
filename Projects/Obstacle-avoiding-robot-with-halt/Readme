A basic prototype of obstacle detection vehicle based on Arduino.

Bill of Materials:

1. Arduino(like Uno)
2. 1 x L293D(600mA motor driver)
3. 1 x Piezo Buzzer
4. 2 x bldc motors
5. Chassis to mount motors and the whole setup.
6. Some jumper wires for wiring
7. 11.1V 1A battery(Preferably Lipo - lasts longer!) 
8. A pair of wheels compatible with the bldc motors.



Software:
1. Arduino IDE(https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed in a working computer.
